# ✅ Verify Skills, Not Just Words.

_Verify Skills_ helps you prove your real-world skills (like coding!) through AI analysis and blockchain-backed proof. Upload your resume, and get a verified skill report—simple, honest, and trusted.

---

## 🧠 What It Does (In Simple Words)

1. _Login securely_ using your GitHub(Due to limitation, we've used Google).
2. _Upload your resume_ (PDF).
3. _AI checks your GitHub_ profile, reads your code, and finds your strengths.
4. It generates a _skill verification report_ (like: "Python – Strong", "React – Good").
5. That report is saved to the _Walrus decentralized storage_.
6. You (or anyone else) can _view your proof_ anytime – verified and tamper-proof.
